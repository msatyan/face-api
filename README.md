# FaceAPI

## Note

This is updated **face-api.js** with latest available TensorFlow/JS as the original face-api.js is not compatible with **tfjs 2.0+**.  

Forked from [face-api.js](https://github.com/justadudewhohacks/face-api.js) version **0.22.2** released on March 22nd, 2020  

Currently based on **`TensorFlow/JS` 2.8.3**  


### Simple Demo
- [Simple Demo](./demo1/README.md)
```bash
git clone <url>

cd face-api
npm install
```


### Why?

Because I needed Face-API that does not cause version conflict with newer TFJS 2.0 that I use accross my projects  
And since original Face-API was open-source, I've released this version as well  

Unfortunately, changes ended up being too large for a simple pull request on original Face-API and it ended up being a full-fledged version on its own  

<br>

### Differences

- Compatible with `TensorFlow/JS 2.0+`  
- Compatible with `WebGL`, `CPU` and `WASM` TFJS Browser backends
- Compatible with both `tfjs-node` and `tfjs-node-gpu` TFJS NodeJS backends
- Updated all type castings for TypeScript type checking to `TypeScript 4.1`  
- Switched bundling from `UMD` to `ESM` + `CommonJS` with fallback to `IIFE`  
  Resulting code is optimized per-platform instead of being universal  
  Fully tree shakable when imported as an `ESM` module  
  Browser bundle process uses `ESBuild` instead of `Rollup`  
- Typescript build process now targets `ES2018` and instead of dual ES5/ES6  
  Resulting code is clean ES2018 JavaScript without polyfills  
- Removed old tests, docs, examples  
- Removed old package dependencies (`karma`, `jasmine`, `babel`, etc.)  
- Updated all package dependencies  
- Updated TensorFlow/JS dependencies since backends were removed from `@tensorflow/tfjs-core`  
- Updated mobileNetv1 model due to `batchNorm()` dependency  
- Added `version` class that returns JSON object with version of FaceAPI as well as linked TFJS  
- Added test/dev built-in HTTP & HTTPS Web server
- Removed `mtcnn` and `tinyYolov2` models as they were non-functional in latest public version of `Face-API`  
  *If there is a demand, I can re-implement them back.*  

Which means valid models are **tinyFaceDetector** and **mobileNetv1**

## Examples

<br>

### Browser

Browser example that uses static images and showcases both models as well as all of the extensions is included in `/example/index.html`  
Example can be accessed directly using Git pages using URL: <https://vladmandic.github.io/face-api/example/index.html>  

Browser example that uses live webcam is included in `/example/webcam.html`  
Example can be accessed directly using Git pages using URL: <https://vladmandic.github.io/face-api/example/webcam.html>

### NodeJS

Two NodeJS examples are:

- `/example/node-singleprocess.js`: Regular usage of `FaceAPI` from `NodeJS`  
- `/example/node-multiprocess.js`: Multiprocessing showcase that uses pool of worker processes (`node-multiprocess-worker.js`
  Main starts fixed pool of worker processes with each worker having it's instance of `FaceAPI`  
  Workers communicate with main when they are ready and main dispaches job to each ready worker until job queue is empty

Note that `@tensorflow/tfjs-node` or `@tensorflow/tfjs-node-gpu` must be installed before using NodeJS example

## Installation

Face-API ships with several pre-build versions of the library:

- `dist/face-api.js`: IIFE format for client-side Browser execution *with* TFJS pre-bundled
- `dist/face-api.esm.js`: ESM format for client-side Browser execution *with* TFJS pre-bundled
- `dist/face-api.esm-nobundle.js`: ESM format for client-side Browser execution *without* TFJS pre-bundled
- `dist/face-api.node.js`: CommonJS format for server-side NodeJS execution *without* TFJS pre-bundled
- `dist/face-api.node-gpu.js`: CommonJS format for server-side NodeJS execution *without* TFJS pre-bundled and optimized for CUDA GPU acceleration

Defaults are:
```json
{
  "main": "dist/face-api.node-js",
  "module": "dist/face-api.esm.js",
  "browser": "dist/face-api.esm.js",
}
```

Bundled `TFJS` can be used directly via export: `faceapi.tf`

Reason for additional `nobundle` version is if you want to include a specific version of TFJS and not rely on  pre-packaged one  

`FaceAPI` is compatible with TFJS 2.0+  

All versions include `sourcemap` and `asset manifest`

<br>
<hr>
<br>

There are several ways to use Face-API: 

### 1. IIFE script

*Recommened for quick tests and backward compatibility with older Browsers that do not support ESM such as IE*

This is simplest way for usage within Browser  
Simply download `dist/face-api.js`, include it in your `HTML` file & it's ready to use

```html
<script src="dist/face-api.js"><script>
``` 

IIFE script bundles TFJS and auto-registers global namespace `faceapi` within Window object which can be accessed directly from a `<script>` tag or from your JS file.  

<br>

### 2. ESM module

*Recommended for usage within Browser*

#### 2.1. Direct Import

To use ESM import directly in a Browser, you must import your script (e.g. `index.js`) with a `type="module"`  

```html
  <script src="./index.js" type="module">
```
and then in your `index.js`

```js
  import * as faceapi from 'dist/face-api.esm.js';
```

#### 2.2. With Bundler

Same as above, but expectation is that you've installed `@vladmandic/faceapi` package:
```shell
  npm install @vladmandic/face-api 
```

and that you'll package your application using a bundler such as `webpack`, `rollup` or `esbuild`  
in which case, you do not need to import a script as module - that depends on your bundler configuration  

```js
  import * as faceapi from '@vladmandic/face-api';
```
or if your bundler doesn't recognize `recommended` type, force usage with:
```js
  import * as faceapi from '@vladmandic/face-api/dist/face-api.esm.js';
```
or to use non-bundled version
```js
  import * as tf from `@tensorflow/tfjs`;
  import * as faceapi from '@vladmandic/face-api/dist/face-api.esm-nobundle.js';
```

<br>

### 3. NPM module

#### 3.1. Import CommonJS

*Recommended for NodeJS projects*

*Node: Face-API for NodeJS does not bundle TFJS due to binary dependencies that are installed during TFJS installation*

Install with:
```shell
  npm install @tensorflow/tfjs-node
  npm install @vladmandic/face-api 
```
And then use with:
```js
  const tf = require('@tensorflow/tfjs-node')
  const faceapi = require('@vladmandic/face-api');
```

If you want to force CommonJS module instead of relying on `recommended` field:
```js
  const faceapi = require('@vladmandic/face-api/dist/face-api.node.js');
```

If you want to GPU Accelerated execution in NodeJS, you must have CUDA libraries already installed and working  
Then install appropriate version of `Face-API`:

```shell
  npm install @tensorflow/tfjs-node
  npm install @vladmandic/face-api 
```
And then use with:
```js
  const tf = require('@tensorflow/tfjs-node-gpu')
  const faceapi = require('@vladmandic/face-api/dist/face-api.node-gpu.js'); // this loads face-api version with correct bindings for tfjs-node-gpu
```

## Weights

Pretrained models and their weights are includes in `./model`.

## Test & Dev Web Server

Built-in test&dev web server can be started using
```shell
npm run dev
```

By default it starts HTTP server on port 8000 and HTTPS server on port 8001 and can be accessed as:  
- <https://localhost:8001/example/index.html>
- <https://localhost:8001/example/webcam.html>

## Build

If you want to do a full rebuild, either download npm module
```shell
npm install @vladmandic/face-api
cd node_modules/@vladmandic/face-api
```

or clone a git project
```shell
git clone https://github.com/vladmandic/face-api
cd face-api
```

Then install all dependencies and run rebuild:
```shell
npm install
npm run build
```

Build process uses script `build.js` that creates optimized build for each target:

```text
npm run build

> @vladmandic/face-api@0.8.9 build /home/vlado/dev/face-api
> rimraf dist/* && node ./build.js
```
